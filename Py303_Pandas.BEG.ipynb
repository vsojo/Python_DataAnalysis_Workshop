    "In this notebook we will learn how to use `pandas`, a mighty data-analysis tool for Python. The main type of object in `pandas` is the `DataFrame`, which is a type of dynamic table (similar to an Excel spreadsheet) in which you can access, filter, sort and manipulate columns and rows in extremely efficient and powerful ways. If you have ever worked in R, `pandas`' `DataFrame`s work very similarly to the ones in R (in fact, in the following notebook we will learn that we can easily interface R and Python within Jupyter).\n",

    "**References:**\n",
    "+ I downloaded (and heavily rearranged) quite a bit of data from the [World Bank's Open Data archive](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator).\n",
    "+ The official [\"10-minute\" guide to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html) is meant to be geared towards beginners, but it makes quite a few assumptions on previous knowledge of both Python and NumPy.\n",
    "+ Pandas also have an official introductory video [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html), but many viewers may also find it rather advanced.\n",
    "+ Instead ‚Äî and other than the lesson below ‚Äî [this tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg) by Keith Galli is a great introduction.\n",
    "+ Once you have a good basis of `pandas`, I strongly recommend the official resources above, and their general documentation, including their [list of specific beginner tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#intro-to-pandas)."
