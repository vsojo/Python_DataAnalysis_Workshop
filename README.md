# Python Data Analysis Workshop
This is an introductory workshop to Data Analysis with Python. The following topics/tools are covered:
1. **Py301 | Matplotlib:** Python's basic plotting tool.
2. **Py302 | NumPy:** Python's package for optimised computing and handling large amounts of numeric data efficiently.
3. **Py303 | Pandas:** Python's dataframe tool to process structured tabular data (data organised into columns that correspond to features and rows that correspond to cases).
4. **Py304 | R-to-Py (rpy2):** Jupyter's extensions to interface R with Python, exploiting the advantages of both languages within the same code.
5. **Py305 | Scikit-learn:** An extremely brief introduction to Python's main machine-learning package.
6. **Py306 | Maps and geolocation:** An introduction to plotting free maps under Matplotlib and Plotly, using both known coordinates and searches by name with geocoders.

## Getting the files
1. Click on the big "Code" button on the top right. This will create a `.zip` file; download it to your desired location.
2. Uncompress the `.zip` file.
3. Open a Jupyter Notebook/Lab session and navigate to that location.
4. Use the `.html` files as reference to fill in the corresponding `.BEG.ipynb` files. In the end, the notebooks should look like the `.END.ipynb` ones. If you prefer, you can make a copy of the `.BEG` file, so that you can always go back to it if you want to start from scratch.

The files in the `Data/` directory contain all the necessary data to be used here.

Alternatively, if you're familiar with `git` you can just clone this repository.
